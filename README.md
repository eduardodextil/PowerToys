# Overview

<img align="right" width="200" src="./doc/images/Logo.jpg" />

Microsoft PowerToys is a set of utilities for power users to tune and streamline their Windows experience for greater productivity. Inspired by the [Windows 95 era PowerToys project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_PowerToys), this reboot provides power users with ways to squeeze more efficiency out of the Windows 10 shell and customize it for individual workflows.  A great overview of the Windows 95 PowerToys can be found [here](https://socket3.wordpress.com/2016/10/22/using-windows-95-powertoys/).

## Current PowerToy Utilities

### FancyZones

[FancyZones](/src/modules/fancyzones/) - FancyZones is a window manager that makes it easy to create complex window layouts and quickly position windows into those layouts.

### Shortcut

[Windows key shortcut guide](/src/modules/shortcut_guide) - The shortcut guide appears when a user holds the Windows key down for more than one second and shows the available shortcuts for the current state of the desktop.

### PowerRename

[PowerRename](/src/modules/powerrename) - PowerRename is a Windows Shell Extension for advanced bulk renaming using search and replace or regular expressions. PowerRename allows simple search and replace or more advanced regular expression matching. While you type in the search and replace input fields, the preview area will show what the items will be renamed to. PowerRename then calls into the Windows Explorer file operations engine to perform the rename. This has the benefit of allowing the rename operation to be undone after PowerRename exits.

### Version 1.0 plan

Our plan for all the [goals and utilities for v1.0 detailed over here in the wiki][v1].

## What's Happening

### February 2020 Update

Our mantra for the 0.15 was infrastructure, quality, stability and work toward getting a way to auto-update PowerToys.  While it took a bit longer to get here, we feel it was worth the extra time to fix bugs that really impacted your experience with PowerToys.

Below are just a few of the bullet items from this release.

- We shipped [v0.15][github-release-link]!
- Make you aware there is a new version from within PowerToys
- Removed requirement to always 'run as admin'
- Added almost 300 unit tests to increase stability and prevent regressions.
- Resolved almost 100 issues
- Made .NET Framework parts of the source run faster with NGEN
- Improved for how we store data locally
- Increased FancyZones compatibility with applications
- Initial work for 4 new PowerToys added for 0.16!
- Created the [v1.0 strategy][v1], the [launcher](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/wiki/Launcher), the [keyboard manager](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/wiki/Keyboard-Manager) specs
- Work on cleaning up our issue backlog and labels

For 0.16, we have some fun things planned and hopefully will be able to ship pretty quickly. Here are the new utilities we'll enable:

- An alternative to Alt-Tab PowerToy
- SVG preview pane for support Explorer
- Markdown preview pane support for Explorer
- Image Resizer PowerToy
